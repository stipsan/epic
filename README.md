Realtime React based two-player game! Inspired by the good old "Battleship" by Hasbro.
Tech stack includes Redux, SocketCluster, Heroku, Redis and more!

It's intended to be both a learning excersise for myself to get familiar with tech I've never used before (SocketCluster, Redis) and sharpen my skills on stuff I've used a lot.

It's also meant to serve as a reference for others who wish to embark on similar projects :-)
